This is a FPGA design to control 3 onboard LEDs and a common cathod 7-segment display using 4 DIP switches. The seven segment diplay can display a single hexadecimal digit. One LED turns on when one of the first two DIP switches is on. One LED turns on when both of the last two DIP switches are on. One LED blinks at around 2.4Hz.
